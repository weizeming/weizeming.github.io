## CFA: Class-wise Calibrated Fair Adversarial Training (CVPR 2023)
**Zeming Wei**, Yifei Wang, Yiwen Guo, Yisen Wang${}^\dagger$
- Theoretically and empirically investigate the preference of different classes for adversarial configurations in Adversarial Training (AT)
- Propose a CFA framework which customizes specific training configurations for each class automatically
- CFA improves both overall robustness and fairness, and can be easily incorporated into other AT variants
- [[pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wei_CFA_Class-Wise_Calibrated_Fair_Adversarial_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf)] [[arviv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14460)] [[code](https://github.com/PKU-ML/CFA)]

## Extracting Weighted Finite Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Languages (ICFEM 2022)
**Zeming Wei**, Xiyue Zhang, Meng Sun${}^\dagger$
- Identify the transition sparsity and the context dependency problem in WFA extraction from RNNs in natural language tasks
- Propose an extraction approach which complement the missing rules and enhance the context-aware ability
- Our extraction framework is scalable to natural language tasks and of better extration precision
- [[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14621)] [[arviv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14621)] [[code](https://github.com/weizeming/Extract_WFA_from_RNN_for_NL)]



## Sharpness-Aware Minimization Along can Improve Adversarial Robustness (ICML 2023 AdvML-Frontiers Workshop)
**Zeming Wei${}^\dagger$\***, Jingyu Zhu\*, Yihao Zhang\*
- Theoretically show that using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) can improve adversarial robustness
- Empirically illustrate that SAM can improve robustness with a friendly computational cost and no decrease in natural accuracy
- Propose that SAM can be regarded as a lightweight substitute for AT under certain requirements
